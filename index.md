## Employment Experience

**1. Quality Control Lab Technician** (January 2018 – April 2019) <br>
    Company: MetalTek International         Location: Waukesha, WI
    <br>
    <br>− Operated analytical instruments, including LECO carbon/sulfur and nitrogen/oxygen instruments, x-ray, and arc optical emission spectrometers
    <br>− Maintained and standardized instruments following Nadcap (National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation Program) approved protocols
    <br>− Performed routine analysis of heterogeneous metals for determination of elemental composition

**2. Research and Teaching Assistant** (September 2019 – May 2024) <br>
University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, Advisor: Prof. Peng Location: Milwaukee, WI<br>
<br>− Designed novel theranostic and prodrug nitrogen mustards as anticancer small
molecules
<br>− Performed multi-step synthetic routes (>13 steps) of oxygen-,water-, light-sensitive
reaction conditions
<br>− Isolated and purified compounds by column chromatography, distillation, precipitation,
recrystallization, and trituration resulting in 4 novel theranostics
<br>− Characterized compounds by utilizing TLC, NMR, LCMS, HRMS Q-TOF, UV/VIS,
fluorescence, and fluorescence confocal microscope instruments
<br>− Evaluated theranostics and prodrugs using cytotoxicity and fluorescence colocalization
assays in vitro with TNBC MDA-MB-468 cell line
<br>− Synthesized oligonucleotides by automated solid-phase synthesis with ABI 394,
purification and 32P radiolabeling of oligo for DNA interstrand cross-linking assays
<br>− Determined safety and anticancer efficacy of compounds in *in vivo* CD1 and xenograft
athymic mice study following IACUC approved guidelines
<br>− Determined physiochemical properties of small molecules (solubility and permeability)
<br>− Determined photophysical properties of fluorescent dyes
<br>− Determined prodrug activation mechanism *in vitro* and *in vivo* through deuterium
isotope-labeled mustard prodrugs
<br>

**3. Research Volunteer** (June 2024 – Current)<br>
University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, Advisor: Prof. Peng Location: Milwaukee, WI<br>
<br>- Investigation of novel small molecule prodrugs and theranostics as selective anticancer and/or fluorogenic agents
